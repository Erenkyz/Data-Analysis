Marathon race data analysis
Overview of the Project
This project involves analyzing a dataset of ultramarathon (UM) race results spanning two centuries, stored in a file named TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv. The goal appears to be to clean, filter, and analyze the data to answer specific questions about race performance, focusing on races in the USA, specific distances (50km or 50 miles), and the year 2020. The analysis uses Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization.
